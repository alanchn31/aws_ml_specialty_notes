## 1. Properties
	a. Store objects in buckets with unique global names
	b. Objects have keys (full file paths)
	c. Support any file format
	d. Data partitioning: pattern for speeding up range queries

## 2. Storage Tiers
	a. Standard
	b. Standard Infrequent Access (IA)
	c. One-zone Infrequent Access
	d. Intelligent Tiering
	e. Glacier

	From most frequent access (Standard) â†’ least frequent access (Glacier)
	S3 Lifecycle Rules dictates movement between different tiers

## 3. S3 object Encryption
	a. Most commonly used: SSE-S3 & SSE-KMS
	b. SSE-S3: Use S3 managed key for encryption
	c. SSE-KMS: Use KMS customer master key for encryption

## 4. S3 Security
	a. User-based:
		i. IAM - which API calls allowed for specific user
		ii. Bucket Policies:
		iii. Bucket wide rules from the S3 console, allows cross account

	b. JSON based policies
		* Resources: Buckets & objects
		* Actions: Set of APIs that allows or denies
		* Effect: Allow/Deny
		* Account/user to apply policies to

	c. Security:
		i. Networking - VPC Endpoint Gateway (allow traffic to stay within VPC instead of public web)
		ii. Logging & Audit - S3 logs can be stored in other buckets, API calls can be logged in AWS CloudTrail
        iii. Tagged Based - can assign IAM & bucket policies based on tags
